#Order Processing System

I made a Java project to simulates (Order Processing System) using linked lists

- Add Order (FIFO Queue)
- Fulfill Order
- Cancel Order
- Order History Tracking
- Inventory Check
- Priority Orders
- Linked List Data Structure
- Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)

Order managed by using linked list
Each order contains : 
- Order ID
- Customer Name
- Order Details
- Status [waiting ,Done ,Canceled]

Check if items are in stock before adding them

Done and canceled orders stores in Order History list
